# DSP 539: Final Project
## Goal: Observe relationships between meat consumption and cardiovascular disease

### Input: 
- A dataset imported as full indicator data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) web page 
    - (to download: https://data.oecd.org/agroutput/meat-consumption.htm > click "download" > click "Full indicator data (.csv)")
- A dataset with the Death rate from Cardiovascular Disease from 1990 to 2017 from Our World in Data webpage
    - (to download: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cardiovascular-disease-death-rates?tab=chart > click "download" > click "cardiovascular-disease-death-rates.csv")
- A dataset including life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population from the gapminder package in Rstudio, which can also be found in its raw form on the       gapminder website (http://www.gapminder.org/data/)

### Output:
- GGplot graphs showing different relationships
- Statistics based off linear models of the data

### Prerequisites:
- R Packages:
    - "gapminder"
    - "skimr"

- R Libraries:
    
    - tidyverse
    - lubridate
    - "gapminder"
    - moderndive
    - dplyr
    - skimr  

- Software: 
  
    -  Rstudio

### How to Run the Program
- Go into Rstudio Editor and input code


### Code Description:
File: code_for_final.R

- This code produces a number of plots and linear models comparing different variables to observe if their is an ultimate relationship between meat consumption and deaths from cardiovascular disease
